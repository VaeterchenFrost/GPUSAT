**This is a short illustrated walk-through for the usage of [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for [Remote Development using SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).**

This instruction was written for Visual Studio Code version 1.43.0, 2020-03-09.



**Steps**

First, we navigate to [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and download the application for our host operating system.

![Choose your installer from the drop-down](/MarkdownImages/001VSCodeInstaller.png)

Run the installer

Accept License

Choose the destination for the application

Select the start menu folder

Select additional tasks - in my case I chose all for the easier work flows.

We get an overview of the selected settings.

Now Visual Studio Code is ready to be installed.

This is how the welcome window looks like today:

First we install the "Remote - SSH" Extension, by clicking the squares-button on the left and searching for it.

After the short installation it looks something like this.
There should appear the remote-tools button on the activity bar.

Also note the small green icon in the bottom left corner for connecting to a remote via ssh.

We click the green icon and have a box with several options pop up.

With the second options we can edit our own ssh configuration.

For this project this is what I used:

To connect to a host, we just open the Remote tools again, and choose the SSH-Connect option.

![](/MarkdownImages/015SSHConnectHost.png)

We can select a server out of our configuration file from the drop-down.

In case there are any passwords involved in the authentication, you are prompted to enter them in the console popping up at the top.

To have a better view at the process, one can open the output tab at the bottom. The 'Remote - SSH' selection to the right shows the ssh-output.

![](/MarkdownImages/018SSHPassword2.png)

When everything is finished, the green remote button changes from 'Opening Remote...' to 'SSH: {server-name}'. 

![](/MarkdownImages/019SeeSSHOutput.png)

Once everything is set up, we can open a terminal on the remote system in our editor.

![](/MarkdownImages/020UseChildConsole.png)

Here is one example of a small interaction, confirming that we are working on the remote.

![](/MarkdownImages/021ConsoleExample.png)

From the left button we can choose a folder to be shown in the explorer.
The folder can be interactively navigated to in the pop up.

![](/MarkdownImages/022RemoteFiles.png)

From there we can open files and folders as we like. 
Files get opened in the editor.

![](/MarkdownImages/023RemoteCode.png)

Opening and editing files can be supported by additional extensions to the editor. Just search the marketplace _(Ctrl+Shift+X)_ or get some recommendations based on the file-extension.
Here are the extensions used for the gpusat-project:


![](/MarkdownImages/024AddExtensions.png)

After editing a file, we want to **commit** the changes to the version control system. After pressing _(Ctrl+Shift+G)_ we can enter a commit message and stage files as we like.

![](/MarkdownImages/025SourceControl.png)

If there were no changes staged, we are prompted with the option to automatically **stage** all changed files. 

![](/MarkdownImages/026StageChanges.png)

For most additional git operations such as push there are the three dots in the source control frame.

![](/MarkdownImages/027GitOptions.png)

If there are no git credentials provided yet, they get prompted when necessary in the top bar.

![](/MarkdownImages/028GitCredentials.png)

To see progress of git operations we can select the Git-option in the output.

![](/MarkdownImages/029Gitoutput.png)

There are also several other output streams that can be displayed.
Here are some examples:

I hope that your setup goes well - happy coding!
